# Human Identification System based on Ear Shape using Convolutional Neural Network
The research study, “Human Identification System Based on Ear Shape Using Convolutional Neural Networks,” aims to provide a secure and contactless biometric alternative for human identification. Utilizing the EarVN1.0 dataset, the study trained five models: MobileNetV3-Large, VGGNet-19, ResNet50V2, EfficientNetV2-S, and a modified AlexNet, achieving accuracies of 79%, 22%, 79%, 91%, and 52%, respectively. Through hyperparameter tuning of the EfficientNetV2-S model—focusing on batch size, pooling layer, dropout, and maximum epoch limit—the accuracy was improved to 92%. The research was conducted in Python, with a GUI implemented using Python Tkinter, which is compatible with macOS and Microsoft Windows. This project was developed by me and my team as part of our thesis research.
